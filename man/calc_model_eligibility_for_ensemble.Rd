that model is eligible for inclusion in an ensemble, with explanation if not}
\usage{
calc_model_eligibility_for_ensemble(
  qfm,
  observed_by_location_target_end_date,
  do_q10_check = TRUE,
  do_nondecreasing_quantile_check = TRUE,
  do_baseline_check = FALSE,
  window_size = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{qfm}{matrix of model forecasts of class QuantileForecastMatrix}

\item{observed_by_location_target_end_date}{data frame of observed values}

\item{do_q10_check}{logical; if TRUE, check condition that quantile at
level 0.1 is at least as large as the most recent observed value}

\item{do_nondecreasing_quantile_check}{logical; if TRUE, check condition
that quantiles for consecutive targets (1 wk ahead, 2 wk ahead, etc) are
non-decreasing for each combination of location, forecast_week_end_date,
model, and quantile probability level}

\item{do_baseline_check}{logical; if TRUE, check condition that WIS for model
is within specified tolerance of WIS for baseline}

\item{window_size}{non-negative integer number of historic weeks that
are examined for forecast missingness; 0 is appropriate for equal weight
ensembles where no historical data is required.  If two past weeks of
forecast data are required to estimate ensemble parameters, window_size
should be 2}

\item{decrease_tol}{numeric; decreases of up to specified tolerance are
allowed}

\item{baseline_tol}{numeric; for baseline check, model's mean WIS for
forecasts within the window size must be at most baseline_tol times the
mean wis for the baseline model on the corresponding forecasts}
}
\value{
data frame with two columns:
\itemize{
\item one with name given by model_id_name recording model id for each model
\item a second called 'eligibility' that is either the string 'eligible' or a
brief description of why the model can't be included
